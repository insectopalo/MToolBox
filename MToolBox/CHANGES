-Check in is a directory
-Use pwd as output folder instead of having to go through so many conditionals
- Support for ultradeep sequencing (samtools mpileup -d / Xmx16g java)
-Other minor cosmetic changes
- Fixed the -l argument (if/elses didn't work for list.txt file). Now the argument to -l can be a file
  or a list of comma separated id's. The file must contain one id per line. It
  looks first for a file with the argument name, otherwhise it considers it as a list
- A bit of documentation should be made:
        - Input file list of IDs can be filename.bam,filename2.bam... etc or just the id (filename1, filename2 etc...)
          it will be seded anyway
